# 🧩 Project Cognify — The Digital Brain Twin

> “The brain is a prediction machine — it constantly guesses what will happen next.  
> Cognify is a simulation of that idea.”

Cognify is a computational neuroscience project that models the **Bayesian brain and predictive coding theory** — the idea that your brain is always predicting your next action before it happens.

This digital brain learns from a simulated sequence of daily human activities and builds a transition model that predicts what you’ll do next — just like your cortex forecasting reality to reduce surprise.

### 🧬 Core Concept
- Inspired by the **Predictive Coding** model of the human brain.  
- Each action (like *wake → walk → eat*) is learned as a probabilistic transition.  
- The digital twin continuously adjusts its “expectations” to anticipate your next move.

### 🧩 How It Works
1. **Behavior Simulation** – Generates thousands of synthetic actions using transition probabilities.  
2. **Digital Brain Training** – Learns from those sequences to predict the most probable next action.  
3. **Neural Dashboard** – Visualizes transition probabilities as a brain-like activity map.  
4. **Colab Notebook** – A lightweight, interactive demonstration ready for AOs to test in one click.

### 💡 Why It Matters
Cognify isn’t just a model — it’s a metaphor.  
It mirrors how neurons reduce uncertainty by predicting outcomes, a key principle in **modern neuroscience and AI alignment research.**

This is how machines begin to “expect” — just like the human brain.
