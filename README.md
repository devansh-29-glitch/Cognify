# 🧠 Project Cognify — The Digital Brain Twin

> “The brain doesn’t just react — it predicts.”  
> *Project Cognify* is a digital simulation of that very idea.

## 🧬 Overview
**Cognify** is a *Digital Brain Twin* — a simplified computational model that learns from behavior and predicts what will happen next.  

It’s inspired by **Predictive Coding** and **Bayesian Brain Theory**, which describe how our brain constantly forms expectations about the world and updates them when it’s wrong.  

In simple terms:  
🧩 Cognify tries to **think ahead**, like the human brain does.

## 🎮 How It Works
1. **Behavior Simulation**  
   A sequence of human-like actions is generated — walking, eating, sleeping, thinking, etc.  
   The digital brain observes and learns from these sequences.

2. **Brain Learning**  
   The system learns *how one action leads to another* — forming a neural transition model.  
   It begins to understand that “thinking” often leads to “typing” or “sleeping.”

3. **Neural Drift (Animation)**  
   Watch the brain evolve in real time as it learns new transitions —  
   like synapses strengthening with experience.

## 🧠 Scientific Inspiration
This project brings to life the **Predictive Brain Hypothesis**, one of the most exciting ideas in modern neuroscience.

> The brain is a prediction machine — constantly comparing what it expects with what it perceives.

Every time Cognify guesses wrong, it adjusts its internal model —  
just like your brain refines its expectations with experience.

## ✨ Why It Stands Out
Most AI projects only *classify* things.  
**Cognify** goes further — it *predicts* and *visualizes thought*.  

It’s not just a model; it’s a metaphor for intelligence itself.  
Your AOs won’t just see code — they’ll *see cognition.*
